# Understanding Comments in Shell Scripting

## What Are Comments?

### Comments are lines in your script that the computer ignores when running the code. They're purely for human readers to:

* Explain what the code does
* Document why certain decisions were made
* Leave notes for other developers
* Temporarily disable code without deleting it.
